Given an array A of N elements. Find the majority element in the array. A majority element in an array A of size N is an element that appears more than N/2 times in the array.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3 
A[] = {1,2,3} 
Output:
-1
Explanation:
Since, each element in 
{1,2,3} appears only once so there 
is no majority element.
